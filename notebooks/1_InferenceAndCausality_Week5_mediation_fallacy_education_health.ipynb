    "## Understanding Linear Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we analyze our data, let's understand the tool we'll use: **linear regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression helps us understand the relationship between variables. Think of it as fitting a straight line through data points to see how one variable (like education) affects another (like health).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** is the most common technique for fitting a regression line to data. The idea is simple: among all possible lines we could draw, OLS chooses the one that makes our predictions most accurate. It does this by selecting the line where the total squared prediction errors are as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: OLS picks the line that gets closest to all the data points simultaneously, minimizing how \"wrong\" our predictions are overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see `health ~ edu`, this means:\n",
    "- **`health`** is what we're trying to predict (the outcome)\n",
    "- **`edu`** is what we think influences health (the predictor)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model estimates an equation like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "health = intercept + coefficient × edu + error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does the Coefficient Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **coefficient** tells us: \"When edu increases by 1 unit, health changes by this many units (on average).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If the coefficient for `edu` is 10.5, it means people with high education (`edu = 1`) have health scores about 10.5 points higher than those with low education (`edu = 0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multiple Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run **two different models**:\n",
    "1. One with just `edu` → shows the **total effect** of education on health\n",
    "2. One with both `edu` and `income` → shows only the **direct effect** (not through income)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these reveals the mediation fallacy!"

    "By including `income` in the model, we've blocked the indirect path `edu → income → health`.\n",

    "**This is the mediation fallacy**: when we adjust for a mediator while trying to estimate the total causal effect, we systematically **underestimate** that effect. In this case, we'd miss about 7.5 points of the true effect of education on health!\n",
